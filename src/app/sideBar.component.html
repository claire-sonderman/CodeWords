Each Team Leader has 9 (red) or 8 (blue) code words in the display that their teammates need to guess. Team Leaders can give their teammates one word clues.</span></p>

                        <p><span style="instructions">The Team Leader gives a one word clue and a number. The number is how many code words in the display that the word describes or is related to. Teammates can guess that many words on the board. The turn is over if a Neutral card or the opponent&rsquo;s words are guessed. If the Death word is guessed, then that team loses the game.</span></p>
